# Dependencies
## Web
### Spring Web
- Build web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC. Uses Apache Tomcat as the default embedded container.
## Developer Tools
### Spring Boot DevTools
- Provides fast application restarts, LiveReload, and configurations for enhanced development experience.
### Lombok
- Java annotation library which helps to reduce boilerplate code.
### Spring Configuration Processor
- Generate metadata for developers to offer contextual help and "code completion" when working with custom configuration keys (ex.application.properties/.yml files).
## Security
### Spring Secutiry
- Highly customizable authentication and access-control framework for Spring applications.
## SQL
### Spring Data JPA
- Persist data in SQL stores with Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate.
### Flyway Migration
- Version control for your database so you can migrate from any version (incl. an empty database) to the latest version of the schema.
### H2 Database
- Provides a fast in-memory database that supports JDBC API and R2DBC access, with a small (2mb) footprint. Supports embedded and server modes as well as a browser based console application.
### PostgreSQL Driver
- A JDBC and R2DBC driver that allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java code.
## OPS
### Spring Boot Actuator
- Supports built in (or custom) endpoints that let you monitor and manage your application - such as application health, metrics, sessions, etc.
## Observability
### Prometheus
- Expose Micrometer metrics in Prometheus format, an in-memory dimensional time series database with a simple built-in UI, a custom query language, and math operations.
## Testing
### Spring REST Docs
- Document RESTful services by combining hand-written with Asciidoctor and auto-generated snippets produced with Spring MVC Test.
## I/O
### Validation
- Bean Validation with Hibernate validator.
